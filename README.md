# decentralized-internet

SCS Hackathon during the ["Dezentrales Internet" Event in Zurich](https://verein-stpeter.ch/werktags-in-der-kirche-serie-in-7-folgen-folge-5/)

# Goal

Implement a working demonstrator how a "local internet" could be bootstrapped in case of a state of emergency when all other infrastructure is down.

Our ambition is to demonstrate:
  * WLAN mesh network among consumer devices
  * DNS in a decentralized way (i.e. GNUnet)
  * PKI for an ad-hoc SSL
  * Messaging with familiar mobile phone apps (i.e. mattermost, mastodon, element.io)
  * Money transfers (i.e. Blockchain-based)
 
To be based on available open-source tools.
